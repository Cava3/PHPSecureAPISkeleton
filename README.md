# PHPSecureAPISkeleton
A simple skeleton for an SID secured API made in vanilla PHP.  
Allows for simple server sided API creation with a secure session and account creation system.

**Be careful, this skeleton does not ensure the content you add to it is secure.**  
**Please ensure you use correctly the functions that are provided here AND your own code is """safe""".**

# Everything is WIP !
# Do not use now !

## How to use
1. Download the zip file in releases (or clone the repository and remove the git artefacts)
2. Put it in your exposed php server (local or docker. Docker compose + dockerfile provided lower)
3. Open your browser to make sure it works (`<ip>/session/connect.php` should return a 602 error in json)
4. Start coding your branches as you like by creating folders in the root directory
5. Make sure to use `/utils/endpoint.php` -> `beginEndpoint()` for every endpoint that requires the user to be logged on

## Security Features
- **SID**: A session ID is generated at each login.
  - Prevents password stealing in console/cookies/mitm if client application is not stoopid (do not store password in client ðŸ‘€)
  - Prevents token stealing (common Discord issue)
  - Newer session invalidates older session, to allow user to disconnect a potential SID hijacker
  - Invalidates session after 1 hour of inactivity, to prevent long term hijacking (again common Discord issue)
  - *Remember to call the `beginEndpoint()` function in your endpoints as it also updates the SID invalidation time*
- **Hashing and Salting**: Passwords are hashed and salted server-side.
  - Hashing forces hacker to brute force the password in case of a data leak
  - Salting forces the hacker to start from scratch for each password, and prevents the use of rainbow tables
  - Slight delay on each API call to slow down a lot the brute forcing process (both password and SID). Low enough to not be noticeable by the user, high enough to be a pain for the hacker
  - *It is recommended to also salt and hash client-side using the username (or a derived value) to prevent MITM attacks*
<!-- TODO -->
- **Rate Limiting**: A rate limit is set on the API to prevent brute forcing.
  - 5 login/register requests per minute per IP
  - 5 other requests per second per IP
- **Confidentiality first**: Accounts and errors are handled with confidentiality in mind.
  - Possibility for multiple accounts with the same username to prevent information leaks (like "password incorrect" or "username already taken"). See Sherlock on GitHub for an example of how this can be exploited.
  - No tracking of the user's IP, only uses the session ID (SID). Nothing stored serverside as you have to pass it to each call.
  - Errors are as generic as possible to prevent information leaks, while still being useful for the client application.
- **Account Creation/Connection**: Account creation is secured.
<!-- TODO -->
  - Username and password are checked for length and characters
  - Username and passwords are non-unique, but the combination of both is (allows to remove the "username already taken" error message, which is an info leak + allows for multiple accounts with the same username)
